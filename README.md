# Split

The `Split` function in Go splits a string `s` by a separator `sep` and returns a slice of strings containing the substrings.

## Description

The `Split` function takes two parameters:
- `s` (string): The input string to be split.
- `sep` (string): The separator string by which `s` will be split.

It returns:
- `[]string`: A slice of strings where each element is a substring of `s` that was separated by `sep`.
